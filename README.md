## Structure

```
src/
  assets/projects/     # covers (Astro image pipeline)
  content/projects/    # MDX stubs → future case studies
  components/          # Hero, ProjectList, ProjectCard, …
  layouts/BaseLayout.astro
  pages/               # / , /projects/[slug] , 404
  styles/              # tokens, reset, global
```
